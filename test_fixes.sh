echo "=== FIXES IMPLEMENTED ==="
echo "✓ Fixed file write/read position issue:"
echo "  - Added position reset to beginning before write operations"

echo "  - Fixed cat command to show file contents correctly"

echo "  - Generated embedded ELF data from compiled programs"
echo "  - Added ELF files to OS filesystem during boot"
echo "  - Updated kernel to load hello.elf and calc.elf automatically"
