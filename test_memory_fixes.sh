echo "2. System appears to be built successfully."
echo "3. Key improvements implemented:"
echo "   - Enhanced heap management with better coalescing"
echo "   - Optimized cat command using streaming"
echo "   - Memory leak detection and tracking"
echo "   - Real-time heap monitoring"
echo "   - Debugging commands added:"
echo "     * heap  - Show heap status"
echo "     * leaks - Check for memory leaks"
echo "     * defrag - Defragment the heap"
echo "     * heapmap - Show detailed heap map"
echo "     * fsstat - Show file system statistics"

echo ""
echo "4. Memory allocation improvements:"
echo "   - Heap size increased from 4MB to 8MB"
echo "   - Better block coalescing (both previous and next blocks)"
echo "   - Shared sector buffer in file system to reduce allocations"
echo "   - Streaming file reading to minimize memory usage"
echo "   - Allocation tracking for leak detection"

echo ""
echo "5. To test the system:"
echo "   - Run: qemu-system-i386 -kernel kernel (may need graphical environment)"
echo "   - Try the cat command with your test file"
echo "   - Use the new debugging commands to monitor memory usage"
