echo "3. Issue Resolution Summary:"
echo ""
echo "   ISSUE 1: Cat command not displaying content"
echo "   ========================================="
echo "   - Fixed null terminator comparison in cat_output_char"
echo "   - Replaced streaming approach with traditional buffer reading"
echo "   - Added proper null termination in buffer"
echo "   - Improved error handling for file operations"
echo ""
echo "   ISSUE 2: ELF execution heap validation error"
echo "   ============================================="
echo "   - Enhanced heap validation with better error messages"
echo "   - Added parameter validation for kmalloc"
echo "   - Improved error reporting to avoid double hex prefix"
echo "   - Added boundary checks for heap operations"
echo "   - Better magic number validation"
echo ""
echo "   ISSUE 3: Tasks command causing system reboot"
echo "   ============================================="
echo "   - Fixed tasks to use safer memory allocation with kmalloc"
echo "   - Added proper error handling for load_task function"
echo "   - Limited task iterations to prevent infinite loops"
echo "   - Used direct print instead of potentially problematic memory access"
echo "   - Added heap status checking before task loading"

echo "4. Testing Commands:"
echo "   To test the fixes, run these commands in your OS:"
echo ""
echo "   # Test file operations"
echo "   create hello.txt 100"
echo "   write hello.txt \"Hello World\""
echo "   cat hello.txt"
echo ""
echo "   # Test heap debugging"
echo "   heap"
echo "   leaks"
echo ""
echo "   # Test ELF execution (if available)"
echo "   exec calc.elf"
echo ""
echo "   # Test tasks (with caution)"
echo "   heap"
echo "   tasks"

echo "5. System Status:"
echo "   ✓ All compilation errors resolved"
echo "   ✓ Memory management improved"
echo "   ✓ Better error handling implemented"
echo "   ✓ Debug tools available"

echo ""
echo "Your operating system should now handle these operations correctly!"
echo "Use 'heap', 'leaks', and other debug commands to monitor system health."
