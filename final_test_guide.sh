# Create a summary of all fixes
echo "=== SUMMARY OF ALL FIXES IMPLEMENTED ==="
echo ""

echo "1. FIXED FILE WRITE/READ ISSUE:"
echo "   Problem: create -> write -> cat sequence showed nothing"
echo "   Root Cause: File position was not reset after write operations"
echo "   Solution: Added position reset in shell.c:"
echo "   - cmd_write(): open_files[fd].position = 0; before writing"
echo "   - cmd_cat(): open_files[fd].position = 0; before reading"
echo ""

echo "2. FIXED ELF EXECUTION ISSUE:"
echo "   Problem: exec hello.elf and exec calc.elf showed 'file cannot be located'"
echo "   Root Cause: ELF files were not loaded into OS filesystem"
echo "   Solution: Added ELF loading in kernel.c:"
echo "   - Generated embedded ELF data from compiled programs"
echo "   - Added automatic loading of hello.elf and calc.elf during boot"
echo "   - Updated filesystem to include ELF files"
echo ""

echo "3. BUILD SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "   - Added ELF data generation with convert_elf.py"
echo "   - Updated Makefile to include ELF data objects"
echo "   - Fixed variable naming consistency"
echo ""

echo "=== FILES MODIFIED ==="
echo "✓ /app/shell.c - Fixed cmd_write() and cmd_cat() functions"
echo "✓ /app/kernel.c - Added ELF file loading during boot"
echo "✓ /app/Makefile - Added ELF data object files"
echo "✓ /app/elf_data.h - Created header for ELF data"
echo "✓ /app/convert_elf.py - Created ELF to C converter"
echo "✓ /app/user_programs/hello_elf_data.c - Generated ELF data"
echo "✓ /app/user_programs/calc_elf_data.c - Generated ELF data"
echo ""

echo "=== FINAL SYSTEM STATUS ==="
echo "✓ Kernel compiled successfully (60260 bytes)"
echo "✓ All dependencies resolved"
echo "✓ ELF programs embedded in kernel"
echo "✓ File system operations fixed"
echo "✓ Ready for testing"
echo ""

echo "=== HOW TO RUN ==="
echo "1. Start the OS:"
echo "   qemu-system-i386 -kernel /app/kernel"
echo ""
echo "2. Or use the makefile:"
echo "   cd /app && make run-multiboot"
echo ""
echo "3. Follow the testing guide:"
echo "   ./run_tests.sh"
echo ""

echo "=== EXPECTED BEHAVIOR ==="
echo "After these fixes, the following should work:"
echo "✓ create hello.txt 100 → write hello.txt \"Hello world\" → cat hello.txt"
echo "  Should display: Hello world"
echo ""
echo "✓ ls command should show hello.elf and calc.elf"
echo ""
echo "✓ exec hello.elf should execute successfully"
echo "  Should display: Hello from user program!"
echo ""
echo "✓ exec calc.elf should execute successfully"
echo "  Should display: Simple Calculator output"
echo ""

echo "ALL FIXES COMPLETE! Your Pepin OS is now ready for testing."
